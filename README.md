============

ChickenPotPi repo for International Space Apps Challenge

This project was created for the NASA International Space Apps Challenge in April 2013. It is a simple website which would be used to keep track and control the feeding, breeding, and caring of chickens.

It is meant to be run on a Raspberry Pi, using Apache, PHP and MySQL. It can be run on a webserver as well.
